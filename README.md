# Bearing_Fault_CWRU
10 class classification from the CWRU dataset. Created as part of my Master Thesis titled "Deep Learning Algorithms for Bearing Fault Classification".

All codes done in Python using Tensorflow library and the Keras API. A case of labeled Classification. These codes contain a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The base CNN structure was taken from https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sv/2017/5067651/

Basic structure of the code was implemented from the format of the insightful article https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/03/convolutional-neural-networks-damage-detection/. Also, many of the functions implemented here was taken from the associated repo https://github.com/dimitardi/deep-predict.
